# Squirrel NixOS Config

My personal config. *It just works on my machineâ„¢*. I do not recommend even attempting to deploy this config as is on a machine. It is held toogether with duct tape, hopes and dreams.


## Cool things

If you are a fan of eww there could be a few useful scripts for you in `homes/services/eww/source/scripts`.

I attempted to make things "modular" by using services to spawn bars. `lib/services/uiDaemon.nix`. So that might be worth looking into.



## Credits
This config is heavily based on [Nyx](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nyx). This is my first time making a Nix config, so the folder structure has been mirrored along with file placement.

Thanks to the entire Hyprland community for helping me!
